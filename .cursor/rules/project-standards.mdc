# David Brower Center – Project Standards

## Best practices

- Prefer **readable, well-documented code** over cleverness. Add comments for non-obvious logic.
- **No TODOs, placeholders, or stubs** in committed code; fully implement features.
- Use **TypeScript** strictly; avoid `any`. Handle errors explicitly (log and rethrow or return).
- **Backend**: Use Express middleware, Prisma for DB. Keep `backend/.env` loaded from `.env` (copy from `.env.backend` when using env files).
- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router, React 19. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` only for client-safe env vars.

## Commits

- Use **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope?): description`.
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
  - Example: `feat(api): add GET /orgs endpoint`
- **Commit after every code change.** When you finish a logical edit (fix, feature, refactor), stage and commit immediately with a conventional message. Do not leave uncommitted code at end of session.
